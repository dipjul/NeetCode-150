# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree
Medium


Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
 ```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10<sup>5</sup>].
- Each node's value is between [-10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>].

## Approach
```
- Recursion
- a variable to pass the maximum from the parent(or ancestor later on) to it's children
- count should be a reference so that any change to it from any recursive call should stay till the end
```
## Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int[] count = new int[1];
        helper(root, max, count);
        return count[0];
    }
    
    private void helper(TreeNode root, int max, int[] count) {
        if(root == null)
            return;
        if(root.val >= max) {
            count[0] += 1;
            max = Math.max(max, root.val);
        }
        helper(root.left, max, count);
        helper(root.right, max, count);
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(H) , H: height of the tree, recursive calls
```
